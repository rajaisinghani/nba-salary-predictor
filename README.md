Dataset of NBA players salary during the 2017 - 2018 season. Dataset was analysed to explore if their is a strong relationship between players' data and their salaries. Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/aishjun/nba-salaries-prediction-in-20172018-season.

The multiple linear regression model had a RMSE of about 4.5 million which is relatively innacurate when compared to the mean salary. Possible reasons may include:

- NBA individual salary cap. The maximum salary of a NBA player is 35% of the team cap. Superstar players could be playing at extremely high levels, yet the cap prevents the salary from reflecting the upper end of NBA players incomes

- NBA rookie deals. NBA rookies are assigned salaries based on their draft position. A high performing player on his rookie contract may be 'overperforming' for his salary.

Overall, the salary predictor still has some viable use. Potential applications includes teams and players using this tool to negotiate salaries based on previous years statistical data. Can be used to gauge what salary bracket a player belongs to based on his performance.
